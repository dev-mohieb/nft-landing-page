NFT website landing page -- Scrimba

I learned about the difference between inline, block, and inline block elements in terms of use
cases, and I applied what I learned by giving the 'a' elements a display property of inline block
in order to design them as if they were buttons.

I also learned about semantic HTML and it's importance in the website's level of accessibility,
which is why I styled the 'a' elements as buttons instead of using 'button' elements. Because 
'a' elements serve the purpose of this website's "buttons", since they link to other pages,
while the 'button' elements don't.
